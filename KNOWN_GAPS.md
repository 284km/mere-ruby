# Known gaps

Divergences from CRuby that are understood, reproduced, and deliberately
not fixed yet — as opposed to the things nobody has looked at. Each entry
says what it costs and what fixing it would take, so the decision can be
revisited rather than rediscovered.

## `p -1` parses as `p - 1`

```ruby
p -1        # mere-ruby: NameError (undefined local variable or method 'p')
p -1.5      # ruby: -1
x = 5
p -x        # same
```

A paren-less argument that begins with unary minus is read as binary
subtraction against the command word.

**Why it is still here.** Ruby decides this by knowing whether the name
on the left is a *local variable*: `a -b` is subtraction when `a` is a
local and `a(-b)` when `a` is a method. This parser does not track
assigned locals, so it cannot make that distinction, and guessing either
way breaks the other. `p a -b` (subtraction) works today and is the more
common shape in real code, so the current behaviour is the safer half.

**What fixing it takes.** A set of locals threaded through the parser —
assignments, block and method parameters, `for` targets, rescue bindings
— consulted when an identifier is followed by a space-minus-no-space. The
lexer already emits space-marked variants of `(`, `[`, `&` and `::` for
exactly this class of ambiguity, so the token side is a small addition;
the scope tracking is the real work.

**What it costs today.** Nothing measured. No gem in the sample hits it;
it surfaced only in a hand-written test. `p(-1)` and `puts -1` (where the
argument is not the first token) both work.

## `require "enumerator"` is answered without checking Enumerator

`enumerator` is satisfied like `thread` and `rbconfig` — no file, no
error — because Enumerator has been built into Ruby since 1.9. That is
right in principle, but mere-ruby's Enumerator is a subset, so the
require now promises more than the object delivers. A program that
requires it and then uses a lazy enumerator will fail later, and further
from the cause than a LoadError would have been.

## YAML is a loader subset, and `require "yaml"` can be lost after a failed load

`yaml` / `psych` ship as Ruby source: block mappings and sequences, flow
collections, the implicit scalar types (including YAML 1.1's rule that a
float needs a decimal point *and* a signed exponent, so `1.0e3` is a
String), comments, and multiple documents. No emitter, no anchors or
aliases, no explicit tags, no block scalars (`|` / `>`).


## `UnboundMethod#bind_call` re-dispatches by name

`Module.instance_method(:name).bind_call(mod)` returns whatever `mod.name`
returns, including an override. In Ruby the unbound method is the
*builtin* one and sees past any `def self.name` — which is the entire
reason zeitwerk holds onto it.

`bind_call` calls back through ordinary dispatch, so for a
builtin-backed origin there is no way to ask for the builtin
specifically. Fixing it means a dispatch entry point that skips the user
method table for a known origin. Every other part of the trick works:
the unbound method is produced, binds, and returns the right answer for
a module that does not override `name`.

## `Hash#compare_by_identity`

Not implemented; `sidekiq-pro` needs it.

The hash store is a flat `[k, v, k, v, …]` value list and every lookup
goes through `hash_get` / `hash_haskey`, which take the *list* and not
the hash's handle — so there is nowhere to consult a per-hash flag
without threading the id through all of them (26 call sites) or changing
the store's shape.

## `MatchData#[](start, length)`

Returns only the first element instead of a slice.

## Integer `**` with a negative base and fractional exponent

`(-8) ** (1.0/3)` is `NaN` here; Ruby returns a Complex.
