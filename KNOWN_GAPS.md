# Known gaps

Divergences from CRuby that are understood, reproduced, and deliberately
not fixed yet — as opposed to the things nobody has looked at. Each entry
says what it costs and what fixing it would take, so the decision can be
revisited rather than rediscovered.

## `p -1` parses as `p - 1`

```ruby
p -1        # mere-ruby: NameError (undefined local variable or method 'p')
p -1.5      # ruby: -1
x = 5
p -x        # same
```

A paren-less argument that begins with unary minus is read as binary
subtraction against the command word.

**Why it is still here.** Ruby decides this by knowing whether the name
on the left is a *local variable*: `a -b` is subtraction when `a` is a
local and `a(-b)` when `a` is a method. This parser does not track
assigned locals, so it cannot make that distinction, and guessing either
way breaks the other. `p a -b` (subtraction) works today and is the more
common shape in real code, so the current behaviour is the safer half.

**What fixing it takes.** A set of locals threaded through the parser —
assignments, block and method parameters, `for` targets, rescue bindings
— consulted when an identifier is followed by a space-minus-no-space. The
lexer already emits space-marked variants of `(`, `[`, `&` and `::` for
exactly this class of ambiguity, so the token side is a small addition;
the scope tracking is the real work.

**What it costs today.** Nothing measured. No gem in the sample hits it;
it surfaced only in a hand-written test. `p(-1)` and `puts -1` (where the
argument is not the first token) both work.

## `require "enumerator"` is answered without checking Enumerator

`enumerator` is satisfied like `thread` and `rbconfig` — no file, no
error — because Enumerator has been built into Ruby since 1.9. That is
right in principle, but mere-ruby's Enumerator is a subset, so the
require now promises more than the object delivers. A program that
requires it and then uses a lazy enumerator will fail later, and further
from the cause than a LoadError would have been.

## YAML is a loader subset, and `require "yaml"` can be lost after a failed load

`yaml` / `psych` ship as Ruby source: block mappings and sequences, flow
collections, the implicit scalar types (including YAML 1.1's rule that a
float needs a decimal point *and* a signed exponent, so `1.0e3` is a
String), comments, and multiple documents. No emitter, no anchors or
aliases, no explicit tags, no block scalars (`|` / `>`).


## `UnboundMethod#bind_call` re-dispatches by name

`Module.instance_method(:name).bind_call(mod)` returns whatever `mod.name`
returns, including an override. In Ruby the unbound method is the
*builtin* one and sees past any `def self.name` — which is the entire
reason zeitwerk holds onto it.

`bind_call` calls back through ordinary dispatch, so for a
builtin-backed origin there is no way to ask for the builtin
specifically. Fixing it means a dispatch entry point that skips the user
method table for a known origin. Every other part of the trick works:
the unbound method is produced, binds, and returns the right answer for
a module that does not override `name`.

## `**` with a negative base agrees with ruby except in the last ulp

A negative base raised to a non-integer power answers the principal Complex
root, and a half-integer exponent (a quarter turn) is exact — `(-8) ** 0.5` is
`(0.0+2.8284271247461903i)`, not `(1.7e-16+2.82…i)`. Any other angle goes
through `cos(pi*y)`, where multiplying by pi rounds first: ruby computes the
same product to more than double precision, so `(-8) ** (1.0/3)` differs in
the last place (`1.0000000000000002` where ruby prints `1.0`). Closing it
means a two-part pi and an argument reduction, for an input shape nothing in
the sample uses.

## Tracing sees calls, returns and class bodies — not lines

`TracePoint.new(:class)` fires when a class or module body is entered, which
is the event zeitwerk watches to notice an explicit namespace — dry-logic
loads on it. `#enable`, `#disable`, `#enabled?`, `#self` and `#event` are
there; the block form of enable/disable and every other event are not.

`#enable` takes `target:` and narrows a tracepoint to one method, matching it by
name — `tp.enable(target: method(:foo))` fires for `foo` and nothing else. Ruby
matches the method *object*, so a same-named method on another class would be
told apart there and not here; `target_line:` and `target_thread:` are accepted
and ignored. A tracepoint created for an event this interpreter never fires
(`:line` most of all) enables quietly and simply never runs its block, which is
a wrong answer rather than a refusal — a program that asks "did my line tracer
fire?" is told no.

`set_trace_func(proc)` installs a tracer and fires it for **call**, **return**
and **class**, and a `TracePoint` watching `:call` / `:return` / `:class` fires
from the same place (with `#method_id`, `#callee_id`, `#defined_class`, `#path`
and `#event`). Ruby also has `line`, `end`, `c-call`, `c-return`, `raise` and
`b-call`, and passes a real line number and a Binding; here the line is 0 and
the binding is nil, because this interpreter keeps neither at run time. A
tracer that counts calls or watches classes works; one that follows lines does
not, and one that prints its events prints fewer of them.

`c_call` / `c_return` are a distinction this interpreter does not have: an attr
accessor is a C method in CRuby and an ordinary one here, so those events would
be reported for a different set of methods than ruby reports them for. They are
not fired at all rather than fired wrongly.

Both cost one map lookup while nothing is installed — per class body for
TracePoint, per method call for set_trace_func.

## Corpus programs must be self-contained

Two were not, and both hid a real problem rather than causing one:

- `76_zlib.rb` read a zlib stream from `/tmp` that an earlier ad-hoc run had
  left there. When `/tmp` was cleared the gate stopped at that program — with
  `set -e`, silently, so `run_corpus.sh` reported the seventy-five programs
  before it and exited non-zero. The stream is inline now.
- `88_utf8_names_and_toplevel_const.rb` printed a non-ASCII symbol, and
  `Symbol#inspect` escapes those when the default external encoding is not
  UTF-8 — so the expected output depended on the shell's locale rather than
  on the interpreter. It compares bytes now.

A corpus program may write into `/tmp`, but it must create everything it
reads and delete it afterwards.

## `caller_locations` answers with one frame, even at the top level

mere-ruby keeps no call stack. `caller` is `[]`, and `caller_locations`
returns a single `Thread::Backtrace::Location` for the file being executed,
with `lineno` 0 — which is what activesupport's `mattr_accessor` passes to
`module_eval`. For a method called from a library's body that frame IS the
caller's file, so the answer is right where it matters; at the top level Ruby
would return an empty array and mere-ruby still returns the frame.

## A Range walks integers and strings, and nothing else

A Range holds its bounds as values, so `("a".."e")`, `(1.0..2.0)`, `(1..)`
and `(..5)` are all Ranges with the bounds that were written. Comparison —
`cover?`, `include?`, `===`, `min`/`max`, `size` — works for any bound that
answers `<=>`. *Enumerating* one is the narrower thing: `each`/`to_a`/`map`
walk an integer range or a string range (by `succ`), and any other element
type raises `TypeError: can't iterate from …` rather than calling the
object's own `succ`. A Date range, which ruby enumerates, is the case this
excludes.

## `Object#methods` lists only the methods defined in Ruby

`1.methods`, `nil.methods`, `[].methods` answer with the methods *defined in
Ruby* on the receiver's class chain — the builtins are branches in a
dispatcher, not entries in a table, so they cannot be enumerated. The call
answers rather than raising, which is what code like rubocop's
`nil.methods - Object.new.methods` needs; the answer is a subset rather than
a wrong shape. A plain object's `methods` is complete, since all of its
methods are Ruby-defined.

## `puts` and `raise` cannot be local variable names

Every other command word can (`require = ...`, `include = ...`,
`attr_accessor = ...`), but these two are treated as reserved words by the
lexer and the expression parser, so `puts = 1` is a parse error where Ruby
assigns. No installed gem does it — the tree was searched before the two were
left out. Fixing it means letting them read as ordinary identifiers in
expression position, which is where their statement syntax is decided.

## The regex engine has no true subroutine calls

`\g<name>` is implemented by INLINING the named group's pattern at the call
site (its captures made shy), which is what ruby's RFC3986 URI pattern needs
and what makes `require "uri"` work here. A group that calls itself would
inline forever, so genuine recursion — `(?<p>\(\g<p>*\))` for balanced
parens — is not supported. Real subroutine calls need a call stack in the VM.

A MatchData holds 64 capture groups (ruby exposes only `$1`..`$9` as globals,
but `m[10]` and `m[:name]` are answered up to 64). A pattern with more than
that silently keeps the first 64.

## `openssl` is a hash function, and nothing else

`require "openssl"` gives `OpenSSL::Digest` (SHA1, SHA256, MD5 — the digests
mere-ruby already ships, wearing OpenSSL's class shape) and `OpenSSL::HMAC`,
written out in ruby: it is two hashes and an xor. Both were compared against
the real OpenSSL, not merely against themselves.

`OpenSSL::SSL`, `X509` and `PKey` are **not defined at all** — not even as
classes that raise. A gem that needs TLS should fail on the constant it
actually needs (`uninitialized constant OpenSSL::SSL`), which names the
missing capability, rather than load and fail somewhere further away. This is
where excon, fog-aws and aws-sdk-s3 stop, and all three stop there having
loaded everything else.
`OpenSSL::Cipher` is the one exception: its `CipherError` is a class that
activesupport names at load time, so the class exists and `Cipher.new`
raises.

Linking real TLS would be a decision, not a gap: Mere has `tcp_starttls`
(OpenSSL, native only), so the cost is a permanent libssl dependency that the
Wasm target cannot carry.

## `socket` speaks TCP, and only TCP

`TCPSocket`, `TCPServer`, `BasicSocket`, `IPSocket`, `Socket` (constants and
`Socket.tcp`) and a minimal `Addrinfo` are real, over Mere's own socket FFI:
connect, listen, accept, read, write, close, timeout. `UDPSocket`,
`UNIXSocket` and `UNIXServer` exist — code that mentions them loads — but
every one of their methods raises `NotImplementedError` rather than silently
doing nothing.

Two known holes inside TCP itself:

- **A listener cannot report the port it got.** `TCPServer.new(0)` binds an
  ephemeral port, and there is no `getsockname` in the FFI to read it back, so
  `#addr` answers 0. Tests that ask the kernel for a free port need a fixed one
  here.
- **There is no `select`.** A read blocks; `io/wait`'s `wait_readable` is the
  identity and `ready?` answers nil rather than guessing.

## `bigdecimal` is not implemented

`require "bigdecimal"` is a LoadError: it is a C extension, and a faithful
BigDecimal needs arbitrary-precision integers, which mere-ruby does not have
either. A Float-backed stand-in would load and then answer arithmetic
questions wrongly, which is worse than not loading — so it is left out. This
is where devise stops, having loaded activesupport, i18n, concurrent-ruby and
its own Concerns first.

## A method call costs ~9 KB that is never given back

The interpreter allocates in a region it never reclaims, so **memory is linear
in the number of calls executed** — 100k calls is 0.9 GB, 200k is 1.8 GB, 400k
is 3.6 GB (`bench/alloc_per_call.sh`). Definitions are cheap by comparison:
1600 classes with two methods each is 0.06s and 25 MB.

That is the whole of the rubocop timeout. `require "rubocop"` is ~250 files
and some millions of calls; it reaches tens of GB (117 GB peak footprint on a
ten-minute run), the machine starts faulting for every access, and the gem
gate's 120-second bound reports `TIMEOUT`. For a library that does finish,
`rubocop-ast` is CRuby 0.3s / 50 MB against mere-ruby 4.5s / 3.2 GB — 15× the
time and 64× the memory.

A profile of the slow load spent half its samples in `strcmp`. Half of that
turned out to be a cause rather than a symptom: the C backend emitted a fresh
region copy of every string literal *at every evaluation*, so each `str_eq
name "..."` in the dispatch chains allocated and memcpy'd before comparing.
Making literals static constants (Mere v0.1.258) took 32% off both time and
memory here; memoizing the ancestor chain took a little more. What is left is
the allocation that is inherent to the design above.

Two earlier readings of this were wrong and are worth recording. It is not
superlinear in the number of definitions (definitions measure linear and
cheap). And `racc/cparse` did not take 61 seconds — a require that *raises*
never returns, so a trace that closes files on return charges everything after
the raise to it; `bench/require_trace.rb` closes them in an `ensure`.

**A region per call is not the fix, and that was measured rather than
reasoned.** Wrapping every method body in `region R { }` reclaims **6.4%** of
what a call allocates: Mere's `map_new` and closure environments take the
default region explicitly, so the frame — the biggest thing a call builds —
never lands in the block region at all. Patching the generated C so both
follow the *current* region raises it to **17%**.

The other 83% is writes into global maps, and those are the Ruby heap: the
string / array / hash / object stores, which every value lives in and which
outlive any call by construction. No call-scoped region can reclaim them.
Reclaiming them means collecting the stores — reference counting or a GC over
the store maps — which is a different and much larger piece of work than the
escape analysis a per-call region would have needed.

So the honest statement is: allocation per call is now within ~2× of what a
tree-walking interpreter of this shape costs, and the remaining factor is that
**nothing is ever collected**, not that temporaries are held too long.

## The Wasm playground has no sockets, no files, and no stderr of its own

`docs/build.sh` works again (Mere v0.1.259 — four Wasm-backend bugs, of which
the first was `unbound variable: skip` in the vendored mgz package). What the
page cannot give the module, it stubs: every socket call fails, so
`TCPSocket.new` raises `Errno::ECONNREFUSED`; `File.read` of a real path
returns nil; and stderr is a separate import now, which the page routes to the
same output panel the program's own output goes to. A program that needs any
of those needs the native build.


## `pack`/`unpack` cover the integer, string and float directives, not all of them

`pack("E")` and its family (`E`/`e`/`G`/`g`/`D`/`d`/`F`/`f`) hand out real
IEEE-754 bytes, recovered by arithmetic rather than by looking at the
representation: scale the value into `[1, 2)` to find the exponent, and the
remaining fraction is an exact integer. Zero (both signs), subnormals,
infinities and NaN are all handled, and `unpack` inverts every one of them.
The directives that remain unimplemented are the width-suffixed and
platform-dependent integer ones (`l`, `q`, `w`, `j`, `!`-suffixed), `B`/`b`
bit strings, `M`/`m`/`u` encodings, and `@`/`X` positioning.

## A String's instance variables do not survive `dup`

`str.instance_variable_set(:@x, 1)` works, and so does reading it back — the
storage is keyed by the string's handle. `dup` copies the string but not that
storage, so the copy answers nil. An object's `dup` does copy its ivars; this
is the primitive path, which does not have the world to copy them through.

## A character literal is one BYTE unless it is an escape

`?a`, `?\001`, `?\x41`, `?\n`, `?\s` and `?\u00e9` all read as ruby reads
them. A literal *multibyte* character — `?é` written directly — takes only its
first byte, because the source is scanned as bytes there. Written as an escape
it is correct, and inside a string (`"é"`) it is correct either way.

## A top-level `def` is reachable without a receiver, or on Object if made public

Ruby puts a top-level `def` on Object as a **private** method. Here it lives in
a table of its own, which is what a bare call looks in; `"str".m` therefore
raises NoMethodError, exactly as it does in ruby for a private method. What
`public def m` (or `public :m`) adds is a copy in Object's table, so every
receiver finds it — which is the whole observable difference between the two
in ruby. A top-level method that is redefined *after* being made public
updates the original, not the copy.

## `block_given?` inside a define_method body sees only the immediate frame

A `define_method` body is a block, and Ruby's `block_given?` inside it asks about
the frame the block was **written in** — never about the call that reached the
method. `C.new.dm { }` answered `true` here, where Ruby answers `false`; it does
now too, and a body defined inside a method that *was* called with a block
answers `true`, as Ruby does.

Ordinary blocks were fixed in a later slice: `def m; [1].each { block_given? }; end`
called as `m { }` answers true, because a block asks about the enclosing *method*
frame, which now records whether its call was given one.

What is still missing is that propagation reaching a **define_method written
inside a block**:

```ruby
def mk; SomeClass.module_eval { define_method(:m) { block_given? } }; end
mk { }        # Ruby: m answers true. Here: false.
```

Ruby's rule reaches past any number of blocks to the enclosing *method* frame;
this records the answer at the `define_method` call itself, so a block in between
loses it. `define_method` written directly in the method works.

`yield` inside a define_method body is a SyntaxError in Ruby and is accepted here
(it reaches the block captured at definition time). `|&b|` receives the caller's
block in both, which is the supported way to take one.
